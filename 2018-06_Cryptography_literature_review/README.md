# Literature research about cryptography

**Location**: Liceo Ginnasio Luigi Galvani 
**Period**: Jan 2018 - Jun 2018 
**Collaborators**: Bruno Buriani, Chiara Ferdori  

## Context
As a final thesis for my high school graduation, I did literature research about the history and importance of cryptography. I analyzed the most significant steps in its development from the Roman Empire to the methods used nowadays, with a brief excursus on its importance in English literature (Edgar Allan Poe).

## Project Description
This research provides a comprehensive exploration of cryptography, covering its historical significance and modern applications. It uncovers ancient secrets and their intriguing connection to Edgar Allan Poe. The study offers valuable insights into the fundamental elements of cryptography, including algorithms, keys, and cipher classification. It traces the evolution of cryptography, highlighting its ability to overcome challenges and become an essential component of the digital age.

The research specifically investigates the link between Edgar Allan Poe and cryptography, with a focus on his renowned work, "The Gold-Bug." Additionally, it explores modern cryptographic techniques such as public-key cryptography and the influential RSA algorithm, demonstrating their practical applications in secure communication.

Moreover, the study examines the extensive impact of cryptography in everyday life. It ensures the security of critical areas such as HTTPS, online banking, certified email, instant messaging, and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the research emphasizes the growing importance of cryptography as a vital guardian in our interconnected world.

All the documents are in Italian.
