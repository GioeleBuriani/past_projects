## Context
Within the Robot and Society course, we analyzed from an ethical point of view the introduction of PARO therapeutic robots in hospitals to treat patients with dementia. We tackled the problem using both value-sensitive design and sociotechnical systems analysis ethical frameworks.

## Project Description
This project delved into the ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of PARO therapeutic robots in hospital settings to support patients with dementia. Our objective was to critically analyze the balance between the benefits of using PARO—primarily its calming effect on patients—and the ethical concerns tied to its use, particularly the issue of transparency in patient-robot interactions.

To address this, we utilized two ethical frameworks: Value Sensitive Design (VSD) and Sociotechnical Systems Analysis. Through VSD, we integrated core ethical values directly into the analysis of PARO’s technological design and interaction with patients, focusing on the potential ethical breaches stemming from a lack of transparency about PARO’s non-human nature. In contrast, the Sociotechnical Systems Analysis allowed us to examine the broader implications of PARO’s integration into the healthcare system, considering both the immediate social environment of the patient and the overarching institutional structures.

Our approach involved a comprehensive literature review and a series of ethical examinations to question whether the robot's comforting presence justified its deceptive aspects. We explored how PARO, by mimicking a live animal, could foster a false belief among dementia patients regarding its sentience, potentially leading to ethical conflicts about patient autonomy and informed consent.

The project highlighted the delicate trade-off between enhancing patient well-being through interactive, responsive care robots and maintaining ethical integrity in patient care. It also set the stage for ongoing discussions about the role of technology in healthcare, especially concerning vulnerable populations. This case study on PARO demonstrates the complex interplay between technology and ethics in modern healthcare solutions, serving as a critical reference for similar future technological implementations in medical and caregiving settings.
