**Location**: Greater Brighton Metropolitan College  
**Period**: Aug 2017  
**Collaborators**: Andrea Iuliano, Leonardo Di Gi√†, Leonardo Rosa, Stefano Babini  

## Context
As part of the Summer Business and Marketing Programme at the Greater Brighton Metropolitan College, we conducted a simulation of the initial phases for a startup, focusing on the development of a travel app. The culmination of the project involved presenting our final result to a panel of investors to receive valuable feedback.

## Project Description
The startup project aimed to create an app called VisItaly, which would provide users with a comprehensive digital experience of Italy. VisItaly focused on delivering a fast, user-friendly, and personalized exploration of renowned Italian cities. Through an interactive digital map, users would have the opportunity to discover and learn about various landmarks, museums, and points of interest. The app would also highlight the diverse gastronomy of Italy.

A key feature of VisItaly is its ability to tailor itineraries based on individual preferences and interests. Users could easily customize their trips, whether they were interested in history, food, or other events happening throughout Italy. The app aimed to quickly generate routes that catered to each user's specific needs.

The ultimate goal of the startup project was to provide a convenient tool for individuals to immerse themselves in Italy's captivating culture and breathtaking landscapes.
