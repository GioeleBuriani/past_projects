# Fixed Axes Case Simulation Instructions

Follow these steps to simulate the control for the fixed axes case:

1. Open the `Horizontal_Rolling_Tongji.m` file.
2. Run the first section to set the parameters (these are the parameters I used, but they can be modified).
3. Run the second section to compute the controllers.
4. Open the `Horizontal_Rolling_Tongji_Control.slx` file and run the simulation.
5. After the simulation finishes, run the last section of the `Vertical_Roling_Tongji.m` file to see the graphical animation of the behavior.
