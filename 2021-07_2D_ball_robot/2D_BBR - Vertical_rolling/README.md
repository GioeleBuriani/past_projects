Steps to simulate the control for the moving axes case:
1 - Open the Vertical_Rolling_Tongji.m file
2 - Run the first section to set the parameters
3 - Run the second section to compute the controllers
4 - Open the Vertical_Rolling_Tongji_Control.slx file and run the simulation
5 - After the simulation finishes run the last section of the Vertical_Roling_Tongji.m file to see the graphical animation of the behaviour
6 - The theta_1_0 parameter can be modified in the first section: right now it is set at pi/3, as in the presentation, but its value can be modified to see that for bigger initial displacement (e.g. 2*pi/3) the coupling is not strong enough and the top wheel falls from the cylinder since the system is not able to stabilize itself
