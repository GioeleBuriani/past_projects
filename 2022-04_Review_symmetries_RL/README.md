## Context
Within the Intelligent Control Systems course, we did a literature review on how to exploit symmetries in Markov Decision processes for reinforcement learning. We showed how, by exploiting homomorphisms in geometric deep reinforcement learning, it is possible to achieve faster and more efficient training.

## Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive literature review on the utilization of symmetries in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enhance the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning. Our study concentrated on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of MDP homomorphic networks, which leverage group symmetries in the joint state-action space to streamline the learning process.

The primary objective was to synthesize existing research to demonstrate how these symmetrical properties can be exploited to mitigate the computational challenges often encountered in reinforcement learning, notably the 'curse of dimensionality'. Through a detailed examination of various studies, including the seminal work by Van der Pol et al., our review elaborates on how geometric deep learning and homomorphisms are integrated to form a more efficient approach to policy learning in MDPs.

Our review spans multiple applications, such as the games Pong and CartPole, and scenarios like grid worlds, which were analyzed for their structural symmetries and the consequent reductions in computational demands. Each case study highlighted in our review illustrates different aspects of symmetry exploitation, from reducing the state-action space to enhancing the speed of convergence for learning algorithms.

One of the key challenges discussed is the accurate implementation of equivariant neural networks, which must maintain symmetry properties across varied scenarios. The review also addresses potential improvements and optimizations that could further leverage these symmetrical advantages in real-world applications.

Conclusively, our literature review not only deepens the theoretical landscape of MDPs and reinforcement learning but also sets the stage for future empirical research that could build on these foundational concepts to develop more efficient and scalable learning algorithms.
