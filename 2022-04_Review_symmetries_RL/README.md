## Context
Within the Intelligent Control Systems course, we did a literature review on how to exploit symmetries in Markov Decision processes for reinforcement learning. We showed how, by exploiting homomorphisms in geometric deep reinforcement learning, it is possible to achieve faster and more efficient training.
