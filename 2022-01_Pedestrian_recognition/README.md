## Context
Within the Machine Perception course, I designed a system that could detect and recognize pedestrians in front of a self-driving vehicle. Initially, I did it only with a single camera data and ground plane detection: in the end, it was possible to detect closer pedestrians and determine their approximate position in the 3D space. Then, by combining also Lidar detections, the accuracy increased significantly and the exact position and dimension of the pedestrians were possible to determine.
