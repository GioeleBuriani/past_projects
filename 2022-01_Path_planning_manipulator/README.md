## Context
Within the Planning & Decision Making course, we created a path planner for a mobile manipulator moving on a differential drive. The robot had to move within a simulated 2D environment with obstacles and reach some randomized goal positions for both its body and its gripper. The path planner was a hybrid form between an RRT and an informed-RRT*, on which a trajectory smoother acted to make the path feasible for the controller (a simple PID).
