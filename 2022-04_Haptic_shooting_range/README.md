## Context
Within the Control in Human-Robot Interaction course, we decided to create an experiment based on a simulated shooting range to test the functioning of aim assist using haptic guidance. We used a Haply device to implement a force helping the users to hit some targets (with a bump and hole method) together with other forces that were meant as disturbances (weight, viscosity, wind). We tested three different weapons with different force intensities on 11 subjects to analyze the effects of the haptic guidance.

## Project Description
This project focused on assessing the efficacy of haptic guidance in improving shooting accuracy within a simulated environment. Utilizing a Haply device, we engineered an experiment involving a virtual shooting range where participants were tasked with hitting targets while navigating various physical disturbances simulated through the device. These disturbances included wind effects, weapon weight, and viscosity, which aimed to mimic real-world shooting challenges.

To rigorously test the impact of haptic assistance, we employed three different weapons, each programmed with varying levels of force intensity to simulate the 'bump and hole' method of aim assist. This setup allowed us to explore the relationship between haptic feedback and user performance under different conditions. Our study included 11 participants who engaged in the experiment to provide both quantitative outcomes and subjective feedback.

The core metrics analyzed were the number of bullets per minute, kills per minute, and mean absolute error, which collectively demonstrated a significant improvement in shooting precision due to haptic guidanceâ€”highlighting an increase in kills per minute by 12-30% and a reduction in aiming error by 50%. Despite varying weapon weights and viscosity levels, these factors did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the haptic guidance.

Participant feedback further reinforced the positive impact of haptic assistance, with notable improvements in aiming speed and accuracy reported. The experiment also explored the role of simulated recoil, adding an immersive element to the shooting experience, which was particularly appreciated by the subjects.

Overall, the project not only underscored the potential of haptic technology in enhancing human-robot interaction within simulated environments but also provided a foundation for further research into advanced haptic feedback systems in various real-world applications.
