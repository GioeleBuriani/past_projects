## Context
Within the Control in Human-Robot Interaction course, we decided to create an experiment based on a simulated shooting range to test the functioning of aim assist using haptic guidance. We used a Haply device to implement a force helping the users to hit some targets (with a bump and hole method) together with other forces that were meant as disturbances (weight, viscosity, wind). We tested three different weapons with different force intensities on 11 subjects to analyze the effects of the haptic guidance.
