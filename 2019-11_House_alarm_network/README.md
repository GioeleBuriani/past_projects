## Context
Within the Logic design of digital systems course, we designed a logical network with the Logisim tool to simulate the circuit behind a house alarm system. The combination of AND gates, OR gates, Encoders, Counters,... allowed us to create a fairly complex system with different features.

## Project Description
The project aims to design a comprehensive house alarm system that covers various scenarios to enhance security. The system consists of five main components: home automation, numeric keypad, counters, siren and general register, and the main body. The home automation feature allows the user to control the opening and closing of doors and windows using a demultiplexer. The numeric keypad enables the owner to activate and deactivate the alarm using a passcode. Three counters are implemented to keep track of time for system functions. The siren activates under specific conditions, accompanied by automatic notifications to the police station and the owner's cellphone. All these components are interconnected in the main body, which includes LED indicators and logic gates for system control and status display.

The project offers expandability and customization options, allowing for the addition of further features and functionalities to meet specific requirements. The system's design and implementation were facilitated by studying relevant literature, utilizing online resources, and using the Logisim simulation program. The methodology involved designing and optimizing circuits, incorporating home automation, numeric keypad, and counters. The equipment used for the project included books, class notes, online resources, and the Logisim simulation program.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive and customizable house alarm system with features such as home automation, passcode-based activation, time-based functions, and automatic notifications for enhanced security and peace of mind. The design allows for future expansion and adaptation to real-life applications.
