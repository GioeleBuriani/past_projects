## Context
Within the Bio-inspired Intelligence and learning for Aerospace Applications course, I had to make a free project regarding one of many branches of machine learning. I decided to choose reinforcement learning and apply it to the Lunar Lander environment of OpenAI Gym. Due to the continuity of the state space, I had to resort to deep reinforcement learning in order to have a neural network as a function approximator. In particular, following a brief literature review, I decided to implement Deep Q-Learning. The results were highly satisfactory, with a 100% success rate within 1000 training episodes.
