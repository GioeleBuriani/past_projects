## Context
As a master's thesis, I introduced a novel methodology for developing interpretable, reduced-order dynamic models tailored for jumping quadruped robots. Leveraging Symbolic Regression and autoencoder neural networks, this method autonomously generates symbolic equations that capture complex jumping dynamics with high fidelity. The approach significantly reduces model complexity, enhancing interpretability and facilitating more efficient design and control of agile legged robots. Validation was conducted through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and accuracy.

## Project Description
This thesis proposes a novel approach for the development of interpretable reduced-order dynamic models tailored specifically for jumping quadruped robots. By integrating Symbolic Regression with autoencoder neural networks, this work autonomously derives symbolic equations that succinctly capture the complex dynamics inherent to jumping actions. This innovative method significantly streamlines the complexity of dynamic models while simultaneously enhancing their interpretability, facilitating more insightful analysis and application in legged robotic systems.

The investigation commences by detailing the methodology of extracting simplified yet highly descriptive dynamic models from empirical data. The focus here is on achieving a delicate balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency, which is vital for the practical deployment of advanced robotic systems.

Extensive validation of the models is performed through a combination of simulation-based studies and experimental trials on hardware setups, affirming the precision and robustness of the proposed approach. This thesis rigorously examines the implications of model simplifications on performance metrics, offering valuable insights into the optimization of dynamic models for robotic applications.

The theoretical advancements laid out in this research are underpinned by a comprehensive analysis of the dimensionality trade-offs involved in model construction, reflecting a methodical approach to enhancing model performance while maintaining simplicity and interpretability.

The conclusion of this thesis outlines potential future enhancements to the established modelling framework. It suggests exploring non-linear autoencoders to further enhance model performance and considers the refinement of the Symbolic Regression library to more accurately track the intricate dynamics of legged robots.
