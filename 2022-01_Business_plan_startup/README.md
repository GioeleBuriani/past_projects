## Context
Within the Idea to Start-up – IT and AI course, we followed all the steps in the creation of a technology start-up until the pitch to investors. We had the initial idea, an app for e-shopping, and we developed all the steps from the preliminary market analysis to the final business plan.

## Project Description
The project, Cloth-E, tackled the high return rates in the e-commerce clothing sector, starting with a deep dive into the root causes, predominantly sizing issues and expectation mismatches. Recognizing the environmental and economic impacts, we envisioned a mobile app leveraging augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer a virtual try-on experience, precise size matching, and style recommendations. This endeavor involved iterative design and user testing to refine the app’s features, ensuring a seamless and intuitive shopping experience.

Simultaneously, we conducted market analysis to pinpoint our target demographic, leading to strategic partnerships with clothing brands to enrich our catalog and implement a sustainable revenue model through transaction fees and premium subscriptions. These steps were essential in fine-tuning Cloth-E’s market fit and operational model.

The implementation phase brought technological challenges, particularly in AR and AI integration, requiring continuous iterations based on user feedback. This process was critical in developing an app that not only met but exceeded user expectations for online shopping.

The culmination of our efforts resulted in Cloth-E, an innovative solution designed to reduce returns by enhancing the online clothing shopping experience. This project showcases the synergy between technology and user-centric design, offering a scalable and impactful solution to a prevalent issue in e-commerce. Cloth-E stands as a testament to the potential of technology to transform traditional retail landscapes, ensuring a more sustainable and efficient shopping environment.
